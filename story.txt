It is late at night in Ohio, and somebody is chasing me in her car, with a weird dark figure in the driver's seat. When it tries to get close, the car gets stuck in a bunch of traffic. Irritably, he snaps at the woman in the next seat to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. After awhile she takes a illegibly blurry photo of someone's license plate.

and has traced the person's license plate number to an empty parking lot in the open. When he demands to know why she hasn't come back yet, one of his phones that vibrated nervously shows him the latest news headline: "A Recent Murder in Downtown Columbus". The shadow figure in the car is enraged, because he realized that he didn't cover up the murder he commited very well.
